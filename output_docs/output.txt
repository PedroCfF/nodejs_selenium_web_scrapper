The Google Pixel 6a arrived with a big challenge in front of it — reclaim the title of the best cheap phone to buy, particularly for those who prize top-notch cameras above all else.

It wasn't an easy fight for the budget Pixel. Since the Google Pixel 5a arrived at the end of last summer, both Apple and Samsung have come out with low-cost options of their own — the iPhone SE (2022) in Apple's case and the Samsung Galaxy A53. On the lower end of the spectrum, OnePlus' Nord phones are nipping at Google's heels with their extremely low price tags and not-bad-for-the-price feature sets. With all of these phones available at once, there's really no need for you to pay flagship prices to get a capable phone.

The Pixel 6a takes on these other formidable rivals armed with the same Tensor chipset that powers Google's Pixel 6 family, giving it a potential edge. And there's always Google's undeniable strength with mobile photography which has helped past Pixel A Series phones stand out as the best camera phones for bargain hunters.









The best Google Pixel 6a deals can help you find the phone at a discount, especially now that the Pixel 6a has been on sale for several months. We've seen deals where you can get the Pixel 6a for as little as $299, which is an incredible price for a phone of this quality.

If you're a U.K. buyer, you'll pay £400 for the Pixel 6a. That's cheaper than the iPhone SE (£449), and the same price as the Galaxy A53 and the Europe-exclusive OnePlus Nord 2T. In Australia, Google sells the phone for AU$749.















































The iPhone SE (2022) lacks an ultrawide lens so to test that part of the Pixel 6a's camera array, I grabbed an iPhone 11 Pro Max. Yes, it's an older phone, but it was still a flagship not too long ago, and I figured it would give us a good idea of how the Pixel 6a can contend with phones that are more powerful on paper.







Just for the sake of science, I captured the same scene with an iPhone 13, which does come with a dedicated night mode but also costs $350 more than the Pixel 6a. Unsurprisingly, the iPhone 13's shot is better where the colors aren't overly warm (though I do think the Pixel 6a handles the background with greater clarity). The point here is that the Pixel 6a photo isn't too far off the mark, and certainly more comparable to the iPhone 13's photo than the disparity in prices between the two phones would have you believe.







Google has started making its own chipsets to power its mobile devices, and it's the Pixel 6a's turn to make the same move to Tensor that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro did last fall. (The phones, released after the Pixel 6a, use a newer Tensor chipset.) The goal behind Google's silicon is to specifically include cores dedicated to compute-intensive AI tasks — in other words, the kind of on-device translation and dictation features that make the Pixel experience stand out from other Android phones.



















We've been trying to account for the disparity between our test results and Google's claims and have come up blank thus far. Anecdotally, the Pixel 6a certainly doesn't seem like a likely candidate for our best phone battery life list — after four hours of photo and game testing, a fully charged Pixel 6a had dropped down to 70%. Still, in everyday use, you should be able to make it from sun-up to sun-down without having to charge your phone. Just make sure to charge the phone overnight if you want your Pixel 6a to last the next day.





Tensor is the star of the show when it comes to special features, delivering capabilities to the Pixel 6a you'd expect from more premium phones. Magic Eraser makes the move from the Pixel 6 to the Pixel 6a, allowing you to remove unwanted bystanders and objects from your pictures with a tap, as I did with the two passersby in this selfie.













The Pixel 6a debuted with Android 12, but it's already able to run Android 13 — the first of three years of software updates Google guarantees for its budget phone. However, in a world where Samsung now guarantees four Android updates for phones including the Galaxy A53, Google's policy feels a little skimpy. Hopefully, now that it's making its own silicon, Google will get a little more generous with its software updates.



So is it worth scrounging up the additional money to buy Google's more expensive — and more recent — smartphone? Our Google Pixel 7 vs. Pixel 6a comparisons looks at the phones side by side. While there a number of differences between the two devices, it boils down to a — and the Pixel 7 does take better photos than the 6a on average, particularly when it comes to night shots as you can see below.
